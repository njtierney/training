    "text": "I provide practical and pragmatic courses in R, reproducible workflows, and data visualisation for professionals in government, industry, and research. My mission is to empower people with skills in data science and critical reasoning, so that they can do more.\nEach course has approximately 6 hours of course content delivered as an interactive practical lecture. There are three “office hour” (60 minute) sessions packaged into each course, which provide an opportunity to ask further questions about the course based on your experience using the materials. These are comprised of one during the course, and two in follow up, after the course is complete.\nThese follow-up office hours provide structured opportunities to practice skills, review concepts, and get help with applying what they have learnt in their own work.\nThe courses I currently offer are:\nEach course will be delivered over several hands-on, practical sessions, which will be spaced out over 1-2 weeks. The learners will have reading and exercises to complete prior to each lesson. As an example, the quarto for scientists course could be delivered like so:\nIn order to be most flexible, these sessions will be recorded so participants can watch the material again if they so chose.\nCourse numbers are limited and capped at 6 people for optimal learning.\nFor current pricing and availability, see the pricing page or contact me at info@njtierney.com."

    "text": "Philosophy on teaching\nI believe the value in courses comes from the time you put aside to learn, and the time with the instructor. I would like for people to be able to learn from these materials for free, if they so desire. The free resources accompanying each course will then be publicly available as a reference source. I believe this is a sustainable model as it provides something of value to the community, and also serves to advertise the courses."
