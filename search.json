    "text": "Course Details\nEach course will be small with only up to six people attending. This means better value and better learning for those taking the course. A core feature of these courses is they are delivered live online, or in person. This means that you get the benefits of the social aspects of learning: peers to discuss content with and to learn from, together.\nCourses will be delivered as interactive practical lectures, with “office hour” (60 minute) sessions packaged into courses. These provide an opportunity to ask further questions about the course based on your experience using the materials. These office hours occur during, and after completion of course content.\nThese follow-up office hours provide structured opportunities to practice skills, review concepts, and get help with applying what they have learnt in their own work."

Courses will be delivered online, although condensed in-person sessions can be arranged in Australia or internationally. Courses are delivered at times to primarily suit those in Australia, although depending on our evening or morning, this may suit you if you are elsewhere in the world. See time differences between Auckland, Hobart, Brisbane, Perth, New Delhi, London, New York, and Los Angeles."
